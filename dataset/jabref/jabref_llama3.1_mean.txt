	ModuleDescriptions : {
		"Represents the most important data structures such as BibDatases, BibEntries, Events, and related aspects. It has minimal logic attached and should have no dependencies on other classes of JabRef."
		"Handles reading, writing, importing, exporting, and manipulating the model. It functions as an API that the GUI can call and use, and should only depend on model classes."
		"Acts as the outer shell that interacts with the user and manages user preferences. It helps users solve tasks by utilizing the logic and model."
		"Contains all information customizable by a user for their personal needs. This module manages user-specific settings within the application."
		"Bundles classes responsible for JabRefâ€™s command line interface, allowing users to interact with the application via command line commands."
		"Publishes events from the model to other layers, allowing the architecture to remain intact while still responding to changes within the core in the outer layers."
		"Provides additional utilities such as preferences management and CLI functionality essential for various non-core tasks within the application."
		"Comprises JUnit tests aimed at detecting and preventing violations of crucial dependencies between the logic, model, and GUI. The build will fail automatically if such violations are detected."
