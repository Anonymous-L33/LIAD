	ModuleDescriptions : {
		"The Facade component is the server-side web front end responsible for delivering websites to users, managing sessions, handling user registrations, log-ins, and allowing browsing, downloading, and uploading of audio files."
		"The MediaManagement component provides the central business logic, coordinates communication among other components, and fetches audio files from a specific location for processing download requests."
		"The UserManagement component handles user registration and authentication, implements password hashing and salting functions, and processes user data queries."
		"The UserDBAdapter component encapsulates database access for user data, creating and sending queries to the Database component based on user requests."
		"The TagWatermarking component digitally and individually watermarks audio files to uniquely connect them to user IDs, reducing the risks of copyright infringements."
		"The Packaging component archives multiple audio files into a single compressed file to allow users to download several files at a time."
		"The ReEncoder component converts the bit rates of audio files, potentially reducing file sizes for efficient storage and transfer."
		"The Database component stores user information, audio file meta-data (such as name and genre), and salted password hashes."
		"The AudioAccess component creates and sends queries to the Database component to list all available audio files."
		"The MediaAccess component encapsulates database access for audio file meta-data, fetches lists of available audio files, and retrieves files from DataStorage based on user requests and corresponding meta-data."
		"The DataStorage component is responsible for storing all audio files at a specific location, decoupled from the database. It handles file retrievals and uploads without alteration, while downloads may involve re-encoding."
