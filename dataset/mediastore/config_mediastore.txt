		"The Database component represents an actual database (e.g., MySQL). It stores user information and meta-data of audio files such as the name and the genre. After the user calls the page to list all available audio files, AudioAccess creates a query that is sent to the Database component. The Database component then executes the actual query for files. All salted hashes of passwords are also stored in the Database component."
		"One of the main components of Media Store is a server-side web front end, namely the Facade component, which delivers websites to the users and provides session management. To this end, the Facade component delivers the corresponding registration and log-in pages to users. In addition, users can browse, download, and upload audio files using the Facade component."
		"When a user uploads an audio file, the MediaAccess component stores it at the predefined location. The MediaAccess component encapsulates database access for meta-data of audio files. Furthermore, it fetches a list of all available audio files. When a user requests files to download, the MediaAccess component fetches the associated meta-data from the Database."
		"Application business logic is provided by a central business logic component, called the MediaManagement component. The MediaManagement component coordinates the communication of other components. Furthermore, it fetches audio files from a specific location (e.g., a dedicated file server or a local disk) when processing download requests. Afterward, the MediaManagement component forwards these audio files from the TagWatermarking component to the user."
		"To allow users to download several files at a time, we provide the Packaging component, which archives multiple audio files into a single compressed file."
		"The ReEncoder component converts the bit rates of audio files. However, a download can cause re-encoding of the audio file."
		"The re-encoded files are then digitally and individually watermarked by the TagWatermarking component. Afterward, the MediaManagement component forwards these audio files from the TagWatermarking component to the user."
		"The UserDBAdapter component queries the database. By contrast, the UserDBAdapter component provides all functions required in order to encapsulate database access for the user data. The UserDBAdapter component creates a query based on the user's request."
		"The UserManagement component answers the requests for registration and authentication. When a user logs into the system, Media Store does not store the password in plain text, but rather the UserManagement component implements further functions to hash and salt the passwords."
