# `results` Folder Contents Description

This `results` directory contains the output generated by applying LIAD to the `Teammates` project. It serves as a practical demonstration of using LIAD to recover the implemented architecture and detect drift between the implemented and documented architectures. Below are descriptions of each subdirectory:

## `20241105_21-49-20_teammates`

This folder contains the architecture recovery and drift detection results generated by LIAD for the `Teammates` project, including:

- `metrics_our_to_GT.json`: Evaluation metrics such as `MojoFM`, `A2A`, and `ARI`, which compare the recovered architecture to the ground truth.
- `comparing_with_gt_project.png`: A visual comparison of the recovered architecture against the ground truth, highlighting similarities and discrepancies.
- `cluster_result.json`: A JSON file detailing the recovered architecture and detected drift. Each `Cluster_{n}` group name represents modules identified in code but not updated in documentation. Each module is accompanied by a description of its functionality, offering a clear understanding of the project's structure.

## `20241105_21-48-54_teammates`

This folder contains the architecture drift detection results obtained using the SARIF (baseline) architecture recovery method on the `Teammates` project. The architecture drift detection is based on LIAD, and the folder structure and content are identical to the previous folder, containing the same three files as described above.
